<p><strong>KINDLY NOTE THAT:</strong></p>
<p>We on Nexa focus on equipping our users with modern skills and access to a digital marketplace. Your earned points through Nexa Stash are not guaranteed to be paid, as our system is primarily designed to reward individuals marketing our products (skills and courses) via sales commission.</p>
<p>However, we pay our budgeted revenue obtained from advertisers monthly to some of our users through Nexa Stash until the allocated budget for that month is exhausted. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to pay everyone.</p>
<p>We encourage you to get acquainted with our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Kindly read and go through our Terms and Conditions again. If you are not satisfied with our operations, DO NOT REGISTER.</strong></p>
